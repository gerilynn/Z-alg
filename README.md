Z-algorithm memory jog (not full explanation):

searching naively for a query string Q of length m in a string S of length n would have a runtime of O(n*m)

Z-algorithm speeds this up by calculating the z-value array.

step 1: prepend query string to string, separated by a '$' or any non-alphabetic character. 
step 2: create z-array. 

geri: FINISH!
